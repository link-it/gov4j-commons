${symbol_pound} Swagger Codegen Ignore
${symbol_pound} Generated by swagger-codegen https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen

${symbol_pound} Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
${symbol_pound} The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

${symbol_pound} As an example, the C${symbol_pound} client generator defines ApiClient.cs.
${symbol_pound} You can make changes and tell Swagger Codgen to ignore just this file by uncommenting the following line:
${symbol_pound}ApiClient.cs

${symbol_pound} You can match any string of characters against a directory, file or extension with a single asterisk (*):
${symbol_pound}foo/*/qux
${symbol_pound} The above matches foo/bar/qux and foo/baz/qux, but not foo/bar/baz/qux

${symbol_pound} You can recursively match patterns against a directory, file or extension with a double asterisk (**):
${symbol_pound}foo/**/qux
${symbol_pound} This matches foo/bar/qux, foo/baz/qux, and foo/bar/baz/qux

${symbol_pound} You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
${symbol_pound} For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
${symbol_pound}docs/*.md
${symbol_pound} Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
${symbol_pound}!docs/README.md
